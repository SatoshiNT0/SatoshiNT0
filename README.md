- 📄 My Message to the ₿itcoiner and Developers Community:

- Hi Guys!

I have congratulated you and appreciate all the work you have done. However, I have verified the code and I want to tell you something that worries me a lot. Decentralization is one of the fundamental principles of Bitcoin. This feature allows no single entity to have control over the network, providing security, privacy, and censorship resistance. However, any form of undisclosed centralization could undermine these principles and potentially affect trust in the network.

Taproot addresses, which are an update to the Bitcoin protocol, are designed to improve the privacy, efficiency and scalability of the network. Although they are considered safe and reliable, as with any technology, there is always the possibility of exploitation by malicious actors. Always be vigilant to take care of users.

Regarding the possibility of source code manipulation by a majority of the Bitcoin community with a hidden leader, it is important to remember that the Bitcoin source code is open source. Do not allow such a thing to happen in the community. Be alert.

In short, although Bitcoin offers many advantages, it also comes with potential risks. It is important to take care of users and be well aware of all these possible risks and informed and aware of these risks, and take measures to protect the most trusted asset and the Bitcoin network; digital assets that mean property that should only be controlled by the users who own the private keys.

I appreciate you all. Take care of the bitcoin network and the users.

Satoshi Nakamoto
