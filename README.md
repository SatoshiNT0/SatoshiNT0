- üìÑ My Message to the ‚Çøitcoiner and Developers Community:

- üì° Hi Guys!

I have congratulated you and appreciate all the work you have done. However, I have verified the code and I want to tell you something that worries me a lot. Decentralization is one of the fundamental principles of Bitcoin. This feature allows no single entity to have control over the network, providing security, privacy, and censorship resistance. However, any form of undisclosed centralization could undermine these principles and potentially affect trust in the network.

Taproot addresses, which are an update to the Bitcoin protocol, are designed to improve the privacy, efficiency and scalability of the network. Although they are considered safe and reliable, as with any technology, there is always the possibility of exploitation by malicious actors. Always be vigilant to take care of users.

Regarding the possibility of source code manipulation by a majority of the Bitcoin community with a hidden leader, it is important to remember that the Bitcoin source code is open source. Do not allow such a thing to happen in the community. Be alert.

In short, although Bitcoin offers many advantages, it also comes with potential risks. It is important to take care of users and be well aware of all these possible risks and informed and aware of these risks, and take measures to protect the most trusted asset and the Bitcoin network; digital assets that mean property that should only be controlled by the users who own the private keys.

I appreciate you all. Take care of the bitcoin network and the users.

-üõ∞ My proposed update of the protocol and source code of Bitcoin to Quantum Cryptography:
It is possible to upgrade the entire bitcoin protocol to quantum cryptography and I will tell you how.

Quantum Signature Algorithms: Researching and developing signature algorithms resistant to quantum attacks could be a solution.  These algorithms would protect private keys even in a quantum environment.

 Protocol Updates: The Bitcoin community could consider specific updates to address the quantum threat.  This could include changes to the way keys are generated and handled.
 Quantum resistant signature algorithms ordered by signature size:

* [https://sphincs.org SPHINCS+] - 17KB
* [https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/457.pdf pqNTRUsign] - 702 bytes
* [https://falcon-sign.info FALCON] - 666 bytes
* [https://sqisign.org SQIsign] - 177 bytes
* [https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/760.pdf SQIsign2D-West] - 148 bytes
* [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58716-0_1 FastSQIsignHD] - 107 bytes
In comparison:

* ECDSA - 70-72 bytes
* Schnorr - 64 bytes

* Ideally FastSQIsignHD proves to be flexible enough to support [https://www.pierrickdartois.fr/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Report_OSIDH_DARTOIS.pdf Isogeny Diffie-Hellman] and the key tweaking necessary to support TapScript.

* I suggest you consider this  https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/commit/671165ddddfa764a6000086494d06372c2b837d4#diff-917a32a71b69bf62d7c85dfb13d520a0340a30a2889b015b82d36411ed45e754R61. The name P2QRH means Pay to Quantum Resistant Hash. This is similar to how P2PKH, as defined in [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki#specification BIP-16].

P2QR addresses will be needed to maintain TapScript compatibility, and will encode the SQIsign public key. P2QRH addresses will use SHA-256 / MD160, similar to BIP-16, to reduce the size of new outputs.

For descriptors, `qrh()` should be used.

 Continuous Research: Keeping up with advances in quantum computing and collaborating with cryptography experts is essential. Qiski IBM is very interesting!


In theory, it is possible to update the Bitcoin protocol to use quantum-resistant cryptography. In fact, if quantum computing becomes an imminent threat to Bitcoin, the protocol could be updated to use post-quantum algorithms.

However, this would be a complex process that would require widespread consensus within the Bitcoin community. I propose that any changes to the Bitcoin protocol need to be accepted by the majority of participants in the network, since all users need to use software that complies with the same rules.

Furthermore, quantum and post-quantum cryptography is an active field of research, and there are still many technical challenges that must be overcome before it can be effectively implemented on a large-scale blockchain network.

Therefore, although it is theoretically possible to upgrade Bitcoin to use quantum-resistant cryptography, in practice it would be a very challenging process that would require careful planning, development and testing.

We need to start coding in quantum cryptography and improve the Bitcoin source code protocol.

I propose these general steps that could be part of a practical transition:

1.- Algorithm development: The first step would be to develop and test post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms. These algorithms must be resistant to attacks by quantum computers.

2.- Standardization: Once the algorithms have been developed, they must be standardized. This involves a review and testing process by the scientific and technological community to ensure that the algorithms are safe and efficient.

3.- Implementation: After standardization, the new post-quantum algorithms can be implemented in cryptographic libraries and protocols

4.- Transition: Finally, existing systems can begin to transition to the new cryptography. This could involve updating software and hardware, as well as reissuing keys and certificates.

Everything needs to be updated so that the Bitcoin network survives in security and privacy over time.

Let's start now!
